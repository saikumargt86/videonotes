-------------------------------------Ansible-------------------------------------

-Ansible is an angentless machine which means we dont need to install any software  on the target machines in order to work with the ansible.
-Where as in the other infra structure automation tools you require to configure the agent on the target machine.
-Information about all this machines will be stored in an inventory file. If you dont create any invenotry file ansible uses defaul located inventory file (/etc/ansible/host)

#to install ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install ansible

ansible --version 

# Inventory file for Ansible

# Define the host group for web servers
[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 ansible_user=ubuntu

# Define the host group for database servers
[databases]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.12 ansible_user=ubuntu
db2 ansible_host=192.168.1.13 ansible_user=ubuntu

# Define the host group for load balancers
[loadbalancers]
lb1 ansible_host=192.168.1.14 ansible_user=ubuntu
lb2 ansible_host=192.168.1.15 ansible_user=ubuntu

# Define all hosts
[all:vars]
ansible_connection=ssh
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

#In the above example, we have defined three host groups: webservers, databases, and loadbalancers. Each host group contains a list of hosts and their IP addresses or hostnames. Additionally, we have defined a group called all, which contains variables that will apply to all hosts in the inventory. In this case, the variables specify the connection method (ansible_connection) and the Python interpreter (ansible_python_interpreter) that Ansible should use when connecting to the hosts.
