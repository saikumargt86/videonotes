#grep

grep is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to search for a pattern in a file or standard input and display all lines that match.

grep "pattern" filename.txt #This will display all lines in the file filename.txt that contain the word "pattern".

grep -r "pattern" directory_name #This will search for the word "pattern" in all files under the directory_name directory, including subdirectories.

grep -n "pattern" filename.txt #This will display the line numbers of all lines that contain the word "pattern" in the file filename.txt.

grep -i "pattern" filename.txt #This will display all lines in the file filename.txt that contain the word "pattern", ignoring the case of the letters.
