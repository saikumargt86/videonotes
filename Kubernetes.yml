-------------------------------------KUBERNETES-------------------------------------
#Kubernetes?
Container orchestration platform. Also knowns as k8s is an open-source system for automating deployments, scaling and management of containerised applications. Developed by Google. Helps us to manage the containerised applications.

#why kubernetes?
The trend from monolith to microservice and the increased usage of containers. It will get diffult to manage many containers so to solve this problem kubernetes came into the existance as an orchestration tool

#features of orchestration tools like kubernetes
1. High availability (no down time)
2. Scalability (high performanace)
3. Disater recovery (back up and restore)

#Main kubernetes components

#Worker node Or node
Which basically means a simple physical or virtual machine. Worker nodes does the actual work in kubernetes. There are 3 main processors that need to be installed on the worker node

1. container runtime (it could be docker or any other container technology)
In order to run the application container we have install the container run time on every worker node.

2. kubelet:
Kubelet is used to schedule the pods(conatiners underneath). Kubelets interact with both node and pod. Responsible for assigning the resources like memory, RAM etc.,


3.kubeproxy: 
Is used to forward the request from the pods to the service. Assume that you have created a replica set for app pod and database pod on two different worker nodes. And if you accessing the app pod which in worker node1 the kubeproxy will forward that request to the db pod which is running on the same worker node.

So now how do we interact with this cluster and how to schedule/restart/monitor the pods? All of these are managed by the Master node

#Maste node
There are 4 main processes will be running on every master node.

1.API server
Is a cluster gateway accepts the requests from the clinet. Acts as a gate keeper for authencation.So if you want to start or schedule any pods on the worker node you first need to talk to the API server in the master node then it will validate the request and forward it to the other processes running on the master node.only one entrypoint to the cluster is through the master node API server.

2.Scheduler 
Is responsible for deciding on which worker node the pods needs to be scheduled. It will check all the worker nodes to see which one is free to schedule based on the resources like cpu, ram, memory etc. and decides on which node it should schedule. Once that is decided it makes the request to the kubelet on the particular worker node and it will take care of scheduling.


3.Controller manager 
It will detect the cluster  state changes (like if pods dies, or some issue in the pods etc). Then it will the request to the scheduler to restart or stop the pods running on that worker node

4.etcd
Stores the cluster state information. Is the cluster brain which stored the key value pair data. All the information in the worker or master node will be stored in the etcd like when pod got reschedule or when the pod got started or died etc. All the processes that are running on the master node will be based on the etcd because how does the scheduler knows which worker node has the available resources in order to schedule any pod. But etcd does store any application data.

Master node can be multiple where the API server and other processes are load balanced but the etcd is distributed storage.master node requires less resource where as worker nodes requires more.

Common kubernetes cluster contains
2 master nodes and 3 worker nodes



#Pod
Smallest unit in the kubernetes. An abstraction layer of container. Usually one pod per application but we can run multiple. Each pod gets its ow IP address not the container. When the container get restarted the new pod will get recreate with the new ip which in convient so to solve this we can another component in the kubernetes called Service

#Service
pods communicate each other using the service. A service is basically static or permanent ip address which can be attached to the each pod. So the life cycle of pod and service are not connected so even if the pod dies or recreated the ip wont get change. So an application should get connected to a browser right for this we need to create an external service(external service is something that will open to the public request) 
http://nodeip:serviceport
http://129.23,232.12:8080
Consider that we have two containers running in the worker node for an application one is for appcode and one is for database, obviously the database container or pod we dont want to expose it to the public request so for that we will create internal service
main functionalities of the service: static/permanent IP address and load balancer

#Ingress 
http://nodeip:serviceport we usually dont want to expose our node ip to public so for that we can one new component called Ingress which takes the public request first and then forward it to the service.



#ConfigMap
External configuration of your application. Consider that your are using a database connection string and you supposed to update it in usual case you need to rebuild entire application code. Instead of doing that whole stuff in kubernetes we have this configmap which is used to store the configuration data like database connection realted content. Not recommended to keep the passwords like data in configmap.

#Secret
Just like the config map secret is also used to store the configuration data but it protected with base64 encoded format. It mainly consist of certifactes, passwords etc. In order to access the data inside configmap or secret data by using the environmental variables or property files

#volume
Just like the volumes in the docker 

#Deployment
blue print for the pods, abstraction of pods. It is used to replicate the number of pods. Database pods cant be replicated using the deployments due data inconsistance.Using the deployments we can scale up/down the number of pods.
Deployments are for stateless app
Staeful set are for stateful app

#stateful set
for databases or statefull applications. Database are always hosted outside the kubernetes cluster.


#Minikube 
one node kubernetes cluster set up where master and worker nodes works on the same node.
It will create a virtual box on your laptop. nodes will run in that box

#kubectl
command line toold for kubernetes cluster. In order to talk to the API server we have 3 ways UI, API and CLI(kubectl) and among these 3 kubectl is the most powerful one because with this we can do anything in the kubernetes cluster. Kubectl is not just for minikube its for the kubernetes cluster interaction.


#kubectl commands

kubectl exec -it podname -- /bin/bash 
kubectl exec -it podname -- /bin/sh


#Configuration files

Each Configuration file will have 3 main parts (metadata, specifications, status)
These yml file can be stored in the git repository where the application code resides or in the seperate repository

apiVersion: apps/v1 #field specifies the Kubernetes API version being used

kind: Deployment #type component

metadata: #section provides information about the deployment

  name: nginx-deployment

  labels: #deployment have it's own label which is used by the service

    app: nginx

spec: #deployment specs,section defines the desired state of the deployment, including the n.of replicas, a selector to identify the pods that belong to the deployment (matchLabels: app: nginx), and the template for the pods 

  replicas: 3

  selector:

    matchLabels:

      app: nginx #the deployment selector labels will get mapped with the below template metadata lables to make connection

  template: #The template specifies the labels for the pods (labels: app: nginx), and the containers that will run in the pods (containers), including their name, image, and exposed ports.

    metadata:

      labels:

        app: nginx

    spec:  #pod/container specifications

      containers:

      - name: nginx

        image: nginx:1.14.2

        ports:

        - containerPort: 80

note:
Template has it’s own "metadata™ and "spec" section which is applies to Pod

Service (sepc selector)will be connected to both deployment metadata labels and pod lables(template metadata labels)

kubectl get pods -o wide #output large result set

kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yam1


to get the output file which is from the etcd database
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yam1 >    nginx-deployment-result.yml #to save into the new file

  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm

#Storing the data in a Secret component doesn't automatically make it secure.

#There are built-in mechanism (like encryption) for basic security, which are not enabled by default.

$ echo -n 'testuser' | base64 #encrypting with base64

How to make it an External Service?

“Loadbalancer": ..assigns service an external IP address and so accepts external requests

nodeport is the one which we can access it from outside :must be between 30000-32767



#Name spcaes

Name space are used to organise resource 
Virtual cluster inside a cluster

In Kubernetes, a namespace is a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. Each namespace provides a unique scope for names, allowing you to use the same name for different resources in different namespaces without conflict.

For example, consider a large organization with multiple teams. Each team could have its own namespace for their applications, allowing them to deploy, manage, and scale their applications independently. This way, each team can manage its own resources without interfering with the other teams.

Another example could be for multi-tenancy, where different tenants or clients can have their own namespaces for their applications, resources, and data. This helps to isolate their resources and ensure security and privacy.

Types of name spaces
1.kube-system: Dont create/modify in kube-system, These are for sytem processes like maste and kubectl processes
2.kube-public: Publicly accessible data. It has a config map which contains cluster information
$kubectl cluster-info
3.kube-node-lease: Recent edition to the kubernetes. Each node has associated lease object in namespace. determines the availablity of the nodes.
4.default: if you create any component like deployment, service, secret etc it will be under default namespace
kubectl create namespace my-namespace

#Different ways to create namespaces
kubectl apply -f mongo.yml --namespace=my-namespace
kubectl apply -f configurationfilename --namespace=namespacefile
#we can also create a namespace within the configuration file like below
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: mysql-configmap
    namespace: my-namespace
data:
    db_url: mysql-service.database



Note : volumes cant be added with in the namespace
to check which components we can add to namespace and which can
kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true
kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false

#change active namespace
If you want to change the active name space from default to anything else, use the below command
kubens #shows the active namespace, before that please install kubectx

kubens mynamespace
kubens namespacename # will get changed to the specified namespace


#Ingress

Any thing that you set up in the pod should actually get accessed by the browser. Ingress provides a way to route external traffic to the services within a Kubernetes cluster.

For example, let's say you have a cluster with two services, "frontend" and "backend". The frontend service serves a web application to users, while the backend service provides API functionality. Normally, these services would only be accessible within the cluster. With Ingress, you can create a single entry point for external traffic to access both services. You can configure the Ingress to route traffic to the frontend service when a user visits the "/" path, and route traffic to the backend service when a user visits the "/api" path. In this way, Ingress acts as a reverse proxy, exposing the services to the internet while still keeping them isolated within the cluster.

First request goes to the ingress from the browser and then from ingress to the internal service and then to the respective pod.

#What is the difference between enternal service and the ingress?

In Kubernetes, both Ingress and External Service are ways to expose services to external traffic, but they serve different purposes.

An External Service: is a way to expose a Service to external networks. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name that can be used to access the Service from outside the cluster. External Services can be either ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ExternalName type.

For example, let's say you have a service "web-app" that you want to expose to the internet. You could create a LoadBalancer type External Service for the "web-app" service, which would give you a stable IP address that you can use to access the service from the internet.

Ingress: on the other hand, is a way to route external traffic to multiple services within a cluster based on the URL path. It acts as a reverse proxy, providing a single entry point for external traffic and routing requests to the appropriate service based on the URL path.


#what is ingress controller?

An Ingress Controller is a piece of software that manages the Ingress resources in a Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress rules defined in the Ingress resources and routing external traffic to the appropriate services.

Ingress Controllers typically run as pods within the cluster and listen for changes to the Ingress resources. When an Ingress resource is created or updated, the Ingress Controller updates its configuration to match the rules defined in the resource. The Ingress Controller then uses this configuration to route incoming traffic to the appropriate service.

There are various types of Ingress Controllers available, each with different features and capabilities. Some popular Ingress Controllers include NGINX, Traefik, and Istio. The choice of Ingress Controller often depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired features, such as support for SSL termination, URL rewriting, and path-based routing.


NGINX ingress controller:
which is a type ingress controller provided by kubernetes.

To download that in minikube :
minikube addons enable ingress

to verify the same:
kubectl get pod -n kube-system

In order to add https to the urls you need to have the secured SSL certificates. So you can create on secret component configuration file
where you can mention all the certifacte realted information and refer that in the ingress component configuration file. with the attribute called tls. Make sure both the ingress and secrete are in the same namespace.


#Helm(bundle of yml files)
- Helm changes a lot between versions, so Understand the basic common principles and use cases will help


Helm is a package manager for kubernetes

you can use helm hub where you can get some helm packages for any deployment anything that you require as yml file, basically it provides the template. and you can you the same 
you can also search like helm search <keyword>

Assume a senarion where you need to deploy multiple microservices (like deployment files, services,secrete etc). Alomst everything is same in every microservice but the deployment/service/secrete file names and some values inside will differ in such cases you use helm chart to define a common blue print and for dynamic values you can you the place holders to replace the values.

One more use case: Consider you need to deploy a microservice deploy across multiple environments like DEV, STG and PROD. In such case you use helm charts in order to make it easier deployment in CI/CD.

This chart can be installed using the helm install command, which will create the necessary Kubernetes resources to run the nginx web server.

helm install <chartname>

#Volumes
- Storage that doesn't depends in the pod life cycle. 
-So when the old pod dies and new created or restarted it need to pick the old data as well from the previous pod. 
-When you have multiple nodes you dont where exactl the pod restarted so the data should available to access across all the nodes in a cluster in order to persist the data.
-storage also need to survive even if the whole cluster crashes.

How to persist data in the kubernetes using volumes?

Persistent volume: 
It can be created just like other kubernetes components using YAML configuration file. kind: PersistentVolume
Can also stores the data which are in the form of files(pdf,excel etc)
It needs the actual physical storage either from local or from cloud.

A PersistentVolume (PV) in Kubernetes is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned and made available to all nodes. It provides a way for a Pod to access a durable storage resource, even if the Pod is moved to another node.

Here's an example to help illustrate the concept:

Imagine that you have a database application that requires a large amount of storage space. You can't rely on the EmptyDir volume, which is ephemeral and not suitable for this type of data. To solve this problem, you create a PersistentVolume with a capacity of 100GB and make it available in your cluster.

Next, you create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that requests access to a portion of the PersistentVolume. The PVC acts as a request for storage, asking for a specific amount of storage space. In this case, the PVC requests 50GB of storage from the PV.

Finally, you mount the PVC inside a Pod running your database application. Now the database can write data to the PV, which will persist even if the Pod is rescheduled to another node in the cluster.

---
apiVersion: vl

    name: pv-name

      - nfsvers=4.0
    nfs:
    path: /dir/path/on/nfs/server
    server: nfs-server-ip-address
    
Note:Persistent volumes are not name spaced as they're accessible to the whole cluster






Persistent volume claim:

In order to fetch the data whatever is stored in the pv, we need persistent volume claim pvc. We can create pvc similar to the pv using yaml file where kind: PersistentVolumeClaim.

You need to mention the pvc in the pod configuration also in the volumes: section

Pod requests the volume through the PV claim

Claim tries to find a volume in cluster

Volume has the actual storage backend then the volume is mounted into the pod

-Claims must be in the same namespace that the pod in. 

-configmap and secretes are local volumes, not created via pv and pvc, managed by kubernetes

-pods can use different types of volumes at time simultaneously


Storage class: 
where there hundereds of pod that requires persistent data we many need to create pv in large amount (the space required on the disk). So in order to solve this issue storage class came into existance. like pv and pvc storage class can also be created using yml file. kind:StorageClass


a Storage Class is an object that defines a type of storage that can be requested by a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
It acts as a blueprint for creating Persistent Volumes (PVs) dynamically. A Storage Class specifies the access modes (e.g. ReadWriteOnce), the reclaim policy (e.g. Delete), the volume plugin to use, and other parameters related to the underlying storage infrastructure. The PVC refers to a Storage Class to dynamically provision the storage required by the pod. The Storage Class helps to abstract the underlying storage infrastructure and provides a level of flexibility to dynamically provision and manage storage resources.

For example, a user can create a Storage Class for a high-performance network-attached storage, and another for low-performance, low-cost object storage. The PVC can then select the appropriate Storage Class for its needs, and the corresponding Persistent Volume will be dynamically created and bound to the PVC.

#Statefulset
examples of stateful applications are : databases like (mysql, mongodb, elastic search etc,.)
What is stateful and stateless applications?
The applications that tracks the state by saving their data in the database.
The applications that dont keep record of it's state means every request is completely new.

Lets conisder an application using nodejs and mongodb database. If there is http request from the user to the nodejs which doest depend on it's previous data (can be considered as stateless ) and it needs to interact with database where it has to update data based on the previous data(can be considered as stateful application)

Stateless applications are deployed using deploy 
Statefull applications are deployed using stateful set component

Main difference is that we cant replicate the stateful applications 

Stateful applications are not perfect for containerized environments


#Services

Each pod has its own ip address 
 -pods are ephemeral means they are destroyed frequently (so their ip get changes frequently when it's restarted). In order to solve this we have service which assigns a stable ip to the pod. Also supports the loadblacing means user will be refering one single ip which then forwared to multiple pods using the service.
 
#service type attributes inside any service type
clusterIP, nodeport, loadbalancer

Types of services:
1. ClusterIP service:
Default service type. When you create a service and didnt specify which type then it will be assigned to clusterip service type.

Service will be having selectors in it and these are connected to the metadata labels. And if a node has multiple pods with the same metadata label then the service will connect based on the targetport in the service section to the containerport in the pod section.

port attribute in the service section is basically service port means for ingress interaction to the service

service end points: are useful to keep track of which pods are the members/endpoints of the service

2. Headless service:

When the user wants to comminicate with the specific pod not with randomly selected pod. It happens mostly in the stateful application where pod replicas are not identical. In such senarios we use headless service.


3. NodePort service:
nodeport value ranges only between 30000-32767. nodePort will be under targetPort. So the pods can be accesible with ip address of the worker node and nodeport IP defined.

Node port service is not secure.


4. LoadBalancer service:

Becomes accessible externally through cloud providers loadbalancer. 
NodePort and ClusterlP Service are created automatically when you create loadbalancer service 

note: Load balancer service is an extension of nodeport service type
nodeport service is an extension of cluster ip service.

In real senario you wont nodeport service for any external commincation.
Either you will you ingress with cluster ip service or 
loadbalancer service with cluster ip service



#Node Selectors and Node Affinity
Are two ways to control the placement of pods in a Kubernetes cluster.

A Node Selector is a simple way to specify which nodes a pod should run on. It allows you to add labels to nodes and then define a selector in the pod specification that matches the desired node labels. The scheduler will then try to place the pod on a node with a matching label.

Node Affinity, on the other hand, provides more fine-grained control over the placement of pods by specifying preferred and required node attributes. There are two types of node affinity: nodeAffinity and requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.

nodeAffinity allows you to specify preferred node attributes that should be matched, but it is not required. If the scheduler can't find a node that matches the preferred attributes, it will still schedule the pod on another node.

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution allows you to specify node attributes that must be matched in order for a pod to be scheduled. If the scheduler can't find a node that matches the required attributes, it will not schedule the pod.

Node selectors and node affinity can be used to enforce organizational or operational constraints, such as ensuring that certain pods run on nodes with specific hardware or run in a specific geographic region.
